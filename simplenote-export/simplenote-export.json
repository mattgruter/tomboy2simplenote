BIOS seems to block that. That's why 2x Radeon GPUs are installed\n- Need to set Intel GPU as primary video adapter in BIOS otherwise it won't be available\n- If Radeon is set as primary video adapter, then Intel adapter can't be accessed by X server (not even visible with \"lspci\")\n- However once booted the X server can't be started on Radeon GPU (using fglrx). It seems as if  fglrx tries to activate the Intel GPU instead of the Radeon GPU. The following error message is repeated in log files:\n\n        fglrx(0): === [xdl_x760_atiddxPreInit] === begin\n\n\n###HDMI audio\n- The open source  \"radeon\" driver works best in multiseat setups. However this driver doesn't support HDMI audio (yet). A patch has been submitted as of Dec 2011 (http:\/\/www.phoronix.com\/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAyMzA).\n- Official OSS radeon website: http:\/\/www.x.org\/wiki\/radeon\n- Until the OSS driver supports HDMI audio, the propietary ATI Catalyst (\"fglrx\") driver has to be used (at least for seat1). Unfortunately there are a few problems with using fglrx:\n\n###fglrx driver\n- This driver seems to have problems when used on 2 GPUs (kernel panics etc.) concurrently making it very unstable for use in multiseat setup (frequent crashes). That's why only seat1 run with fglrx and seat0 runs with radeon.\n- fglrx interferes with the OSS driver \"radeon\" and prevents it from starting 3D acceleration. This could be caused by the fglrx installation itself (files, kernel module, etc.) or by the fact that seat1 runs with propietary driver \"fglrx\" at the same time as seat0 uses \"radeon\".  \n    (see https:\/\/wiki.ubuntu.com\/X\/Troubleshooting\/FglrxInteferesWithRadeonDriver).  \n    X outputs the following error message:\n\n            (EE) GLX error: Can not get required symbols\n\n- It's propietary\n- Unstable\n- Gnome-shell\/unity rendering problems\n\n###udev device names not persistent\n- The udev device names are not reliably persistent: if the USB cables are unplugged and then plugged in again, the \"persistent\" device names in \/dev\/input\/by-id and \/dev\/inpt\/by-path change. As a consequence xorg.conf has to be updated with the correct input device names now and then.   \n    see https:\/\/bugs.launchpad.net\/ubuntu\/+source\/udev\/+bug\/722411  \n    more information about udev: http:\/\/doc.opensuse.org\/products\/opensuse\/openSUSE\/opensuse-reference\/cha.udev.html\n\n###Apple Bluetooth Keyboard connectin problems\n- Sometimes it's impossible to connect to the keyboard. Even removing it and re-pairing doens't solve it.\n- The bluetooth connection is user-based and configured from within GNOME. Is it possible to setup the keyboard system-wide so that it becomes available right after boot.  \n    see http:\/\/www.thetechrepo.com\/main-articles\/520-how-to-connect-an-apple-bluetooth-keyboard-toubuntu-troubleshooting\n\n###LightDM bug\n- LightDM doesn't add \"-sharevts\" to the X command line. This has to be manually appended in the config file.  \n    see https:\/\/bugs.launchpad.net\/lightdm\/+bug\/903194\n", "modified": "Jun 24 2012 21:55:50", "key": "agtzaW1wbGUtbm90ZXIqCxIETm90ZSIgNGViN2VlM2I4YzNjMmZmMTc1ZmE0ODU2ZGMxZGJhODAM", "created": "Jun 24 2012 21:45:02"}, {"content": "Android\n======\n\nUnfortunately simplenote does not have an official Android client.
